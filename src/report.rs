//! Human-readable diagnostic report, exposed as an MCP resource.
//!
//! Resources are application-driven: the host decides whether to pull them into
//! context, with no tool call and no model decision. That makes this the
//! zero-friction path for "here is what my Wi-Fi looks like", while the tools
//! remain the path for model-initiated and parameterised queries.
//!
//! Deliberately serves the CACHED scan. A read must never trigger a hidden
//! scan: clients may read resources speculatively or on every turn, and a hidden
//! multi-second stall on a passive read is bad behaviour. Freshness is made
//! legible in the body instead.
